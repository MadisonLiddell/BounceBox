# BounceBox
Designed and developed by Madison Liddell.

A simple OpenGL scene that displays a transparent cube with a bouncing ball inside. Utilizes object/model loading, GLFW, GLM, textures, and Vertex and Fragment shaders (GLSL).

You can move around in the scene with the arrow keys; left and right pan the camera sideways, up and down change the viewing angle and push the camera forward or back.

It was created as my first OpenGL app to learn how to program graphics in C++, use shaders, and use modern MVP manipulation.
